# System Event Log

A system event log is a chronological record of significant events affecting your systems. It provides historical context for troubleshooting, pattern recognition, and continuous improvement.

## Purpose

- **Knowledge Retention**: Preserve institutional knowledge
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory or audit requirements
- **Communication**: Share system history with stakeholders

## What to Log

### 1. Deployments
- Version deployed
- Components affected
- Deployment time and duration
- Responsible team/individual
- Rollback status (if applicable)

### 2. Configuration Changes
- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- Who authorized the change
- Impact assessment

### 3. Incidents
- Brief description
- Start and end times
- Impact (services affected, users affected)
- Resolution steps
- Link to post-mortem

### 4. Maintenance Activities
- Type of maintenance
- Systems affected
- Duration
- Outcome

## Implementation Options

- **Dedicated Tool**: Use specialized event logging software
- **Shared Document**: Maintain a structured document (wiki, spreadsheet)
- **Version Control**: Store in version control with the codebase
- **Automated Collection**: Aggregate from CI/CD, monitoring systems

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Use consistent formatting and terminology
