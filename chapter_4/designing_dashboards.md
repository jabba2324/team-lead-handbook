# Designing Dashboards

Effective dashboards provide at-a-glance visibility into system health, performance, and business metrics. They help teams make data-driven decisions and quickly identify issues.

## Dashboard Types

### 1. Operational Dashboards
- Real-time system health and performance
- Current status of services
- Active incidents and alerts
- Key operational metrics (traffic, errors, latency)

### 2. Analytical Dashboards
- Trends over time
- Comparative analysis
- Deeper insights for decision-making
- Business impact metrics

### 3. Executive Dashboards
- High-level KPIs
- Business outcomes
- Strategic metrics
- Simplified visualizations

## Design Principles

### 1. Purpose-Driven
- Start with clear objectives
- Identify the target audience
- Define key questions the dashboard should answer
- Limit scope to maintain focus

### 2. Visual Hierarchy
- Most important metrics most prominent
- Logical grouping of related metrics
- Consistent layout and design
- Use color purposefully (red for alerts, etc.)

### 3. Data Visualization
- Choose appropriate chart types for each metric
- Avoid chart junk and 3D effects
- Use consistent scales and baselines
- Include context (thresholds, targets, historical comparison)

### 4. Usability
- Intuitive navigation
- Interactive elements where helpful
- Responsive design for different devices
- Clear labels and legends

## Implementation Best Practices

- **Iterate**: Start simple and refine based on feedback
- **Standardize**: Use consistent naming and visualization across dashboards
- **Document**: Include explanations of metrics and data sources
- **Test**: Verify dashboard accuracy and performance
- **Maintain**: Regularly review and update as needs change
