**Detected by**: Automated alert from payment failure rate monitor

**Incident Commander**: Sarah Chen, SRE Lead

## Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Event |
|------------|-------|
| 09:17 | Payment failure rate exceeded 50% threshold, triggering PagerDuty alert |
| 09:22 | SRE on-call engineer acknowledged alert and began investigation |
| 09:28 | Incident declared; incident response team assembled |
| 09:35 | Initial assessment: Database connection pool exhaustion identified |
| 09:42 | Attempted mitigation: Database connection pool size increased |
| 09:55 | Mitigation unsuccessful; deeper investigation initiated |
| 10:10 | Root cause identified: Database deadlocks due to recent code deployment |
| 10:25 | Decision made to roll back recent deployment |
| 10:40 | Rollback initiated |
| 11:15 | Rollback completed, but system still experiencing issues |
| 11:30 | Database locks manually cleared |
| 11:45 | Payment success rate improving but still below normal |
| 12:20 | Database query optimization implemented as temporary fix |
| 13:15 | Payment system returned to >95% success rate |
| 13:45 | All monitoring systems showing normal operation |
| 13:59 | Incident declared resolved |
| 14:30 | Post-mortem scheduled |

## Root Cause Analysis

The outage was caused by a database deadlock situation that occurred after a deployment on June 14th at 22:00 UTC. The deployment included a change to the payment processing service that modified the order of database operations when processing a payment.

Specifically:
1. The new code changed the transaction isolation level from READ COMMITTED to SERIALIZABLE for payment operations
2. This change, combined with increased payment volume during a flash sale, led to an increased rate of database deadlocks
3. The deadlocks caused database connections to remain open longer than expected
4. This eventually exhausted the connection pool, preventing new payment transactions from being processed

The issue was not caught in testing because:
1. The test environment uses a smaller dataset that doesn't trigger the same locking patterns
2. Load testing was performed but not at the volume experienced during the flash sale
3. The specific sequence of operations that triggered the deadlocks occurs only in approximately 5% of transactions

## Impact

- **Customers**: ~15,000 customers unable to complete purchases
- **Orders**: ~12,000 orders affected (8,000 failed, 4,000 delayed)
- **Revenue**: Estimated $120,000 in delayed or lost revenue
- **Reputation**: Significant social media activity (~500 mentions)
- **Support**: 320 support tickets opened related to payment failures

## What Went Well

1. **Monitoring**: Automated alerts detected the issue within 2 minutes of onset
2. **Response Time**: On-call engineer responded within 5 minutes
3. **Communication**: Regular updates were provided to stakeholders throughout the incident
4. **Runbook**: Database connection pool troubleshooting runbook helped with initial diagnosis

## What Went Poorly

1. **Testing**: Pre-deployment testing did not catch the issue
2. **Deployment Timing**: Deployment was made just before a major marketing event
3. **Rollback Decision**: Decision to roll back was delayed by ~30 minutes while attempting fixes
4. **Database Expertise**: Limited database expertise available during initial response

## Action Items

| Action | Type | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|--------|------|-------|----------|--------|
| Implement database deadlock detection in monitoring | Prevention | Database Team | June 30, 2023 | In Progress |
| Update load testing to include flash sale volumes | Prevention | QA Team | July 15, 2023 | Not Started |
| Add transaction isolation level checks to code review checklist | Prevention | Development Team | June 20, 2023 | Completed |
| Create runbook for identifying and resolving database deadlocks | Mitigation | SRE Team | July 7, 2023 | In Progress |
| Schedule database performance training for on-call engineers | Process | Engineering Managers | July 30, 2023 | Not Started |
| Implement circuit breaker pattern in payment service | Mitigation | Payment Team | August 15, 2023 | Not Started |
| Review deployment scheduling policy | Process | Release Management | June 25, 2023 | In Progress |
| Improve customer communication during payment outages | Response | Customer Support | July 10, 2023 | Not Started |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Database Configuration Changes**: Changes to transaction isolation levels should be treated as high-risk changes requiring additional review and testing.

2. **Load Testing**: Our load testing should include scenarios that match our peak traffic patterns, including flash sales and promotional events.

3. **Deployment Windows**: Major changes should not be deployed within 48 hours of planned marketing events or expected traffic spikes.

4. **Rollback Readiness**: We should have a lower threshold for initiating rollbacks when issues affect critical payment systems.

5. **Cross-Team Expertise**: We need to ensure database expertise is available during incident response, either through training or by including DBAs in the on-call rotation.

### Relevant Metrics

- Database connection pool utilization: Peaked at 100% at 09:20 UTC
- Database deadlock count: 432 deadlocks detected between 09:00-10:00 UTC
- Payment API error rate: Peaked at 93% at 09:45 UTC
- API latency: Increased from 120ms to 3200ms average during the incident

### Code Change

```java
// Before
@Transactional(isolation = Isolation.READ_COMMITTED)
public PaymentResult processPayment(Payment payment) {
    // Payment processing logic
}

// After
@Transactional(isolation = Isolation.SERIALIZABLE)
public PaymentResult processPayment(Payment payment) {
    // Payment processing logic
}
```
