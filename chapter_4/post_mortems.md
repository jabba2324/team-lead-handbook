# Post Mortems

Post mortems (also called post-incident reviews or retrospectives) are structured analyses conducted after incidents to understand what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## Key Principles

- **Blameless**: Focus on systems and processes, not individuals
- **Transparent**: Share findings openly within the organization
- **Action-oriented**: Identify concrete improvements
- **Timely**: Conduct while details are fresh

## Post Mortem Template

### 1. Incident Summary
- Brief description
- Timeline (detection, response, resolution)
- Impact (users affected, duration, business cost)
- Detection method

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
- What happened (technical details)
- Why it happened (contributing factors)
- How it escalated
- Why it wasn't caught earlier

### 3. Response Assessment
- What went well
- What could have gone better
- Communication effectiveness
- Tools and processes evaluation

### 4. Action Items
- Specific, assignable tasks
- Preventive measures
- Detection improvements
- Response improvements
- Timeline for implementation
- Priority levels

### 5. Lessons Learned
- Key takeaways
- Broader implications
- Knowledge gaps identified

## Best Practices

- **Schedule Promptly**: Hold within 1-2 days of resolution
- **Involve Key Participants**: Include responders and stakeholders
- **Prepare Data**: Gather logs, timelines, and metrics beforehand
- **Facilitate Effectively**: Keep discussion focused and constructive
- **Follow Up**: Track action items to completion
- **Share Knowledge**: Distribute findings to relevant teams
