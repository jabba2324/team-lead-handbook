This glossary provides definitions for terms used throughout the Team Lead Handbook.

## A

**API (Application Programming Interface)** - A set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

## C

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)** - A method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development, from integration and testing phases to delivery and deployment.

**Cyclomatic Complexity** - A software metric used to indicate the complexity of a program by measuring the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code.

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** - An architectural pattern that separates read and write operations for a data store, using different models for updating and reading information.

## D

**Dependency Auditing** - The practice of continuously monitoring and evaluating third-party components for vulnerabilities, license compliance, and malicious code.

**Dependency Confusion** - A type of supply chain attack that exploits private package names by publishing public packages with the same name.

**DORA Metrics** - Four key metrics identified by the DevOps Research and Assessment team that indicate the performance of software development teams: Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Mean Time to Restore, and Change Failure Rate.

## E

**Event Sourcing** - An architectural pattern where changes to application state are stored as a sequence of events, which can be used to reconstruct the state at any point in time.

## L

**Linting** - The process of running a program that analyzes code for potential errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.

**LTS (Long-Term Support)** - A product lifecycle management policy in which a stable release of software is maintained for a longer period than the standard edition.

**Lean Coffee** - A structured but agenda-less meeting where participants gather, build an agenda, and begin discussing topics in order of importance.

## O

**OWASP Top 10** - A standard awareness document for developers and web application security, representing a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

## P

**Post Mortem** - A structured analysis conducted after an incident to understand what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## R

**Runbook** - A compilation of procedures and operations that a system administrator or operator follows to ensure proper system functioning.

## S

**SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)** - A formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software.

**Skills Matrix** - A visual tool used to assess and document the skills, competencies, and knowledge of team members.

**Sequence Diagram** - A type of UML diagram that shows object interactions arranged in time sequence.

**Structured Logging** - An approach to logging where log entries are formatted as structured data (typically JSON) rather than plain text strings, making logs machine-readable and searchable.

**Supply Chain Attack** - A cyber-attack that targets less-secure elements in the software supply chain rather than attacking the target application directly.

## T

**Tech Debt** - The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

**Team API** - A document that communicates what a team does and how people can interact with them.

**Team Health Chart** - A visual representation of various aspects of team health, such as morale, delivery, technical quality, etc.

**Trace ID** - A unique identifier that follows a request through the entire system, used in distributed tracing and structured logging.

**Typosquatting** - A type of supply chain attack that involves publishing malicious packages with names similar to popular packages.
