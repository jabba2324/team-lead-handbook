# The Team Lead Handbook
The team lead handbook is a collection of resources & tools for team leads, engineering managers or similiar roles. It coveres a really broad range of topics from capturing the state of a dev team, code health, operational excellence and more. It can help you better understand your domain and support reasoning when communicating with a CTO or Head Of Eng.

Having said that if you work in an adjcant discipline such as delivery, product or quality you might also find some chapters useful.

Very few things in the handbook are the authors own work rather things they come accross throughout their career at Build Circle. In no particular order we categorised the frameworks/tools below.
