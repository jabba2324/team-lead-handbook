# The Team Lead Handbook
The Team Lead Handbook is a collection of resources & tools for team leads, engineering managers or similar roles. It covers a broad range of topics from capturing the state of a dev team, code health, operational excellence and more. It can help you better understand your domain and support reasoning when communicating with a CTO or Head of Engineering.

If you work in an adjacent discipline such as delivery, product or quality, you might also find some chapters useful.
