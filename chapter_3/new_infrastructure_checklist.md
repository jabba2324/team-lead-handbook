# Checklist for New Infrastructure

When introducing new infrastructure components, use this checklist to ensure a smooth implementation and minimize operational risks.

## Planning Phase

- **Requirements Analysis**: Document specific needs and constraints
- **Cost Analysis**: Calculate TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)
- **Scalability Planning**: Ensure the solution can scale with your needs
- **Security Assessment**: Identify potential security concerns
- **Compliance Check**: Verify compliance with relevant regulations
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Document recovery procedures
- **Backup Strategy**: Define backup frequency and retention policies

## Implementation Phase

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use IaC tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)
- **Environment Parity**: Ensure dev/test environments match production
- **CI/CD Integration**: Update pipelines to work with new infrastructure
- **Documentation**: Create/update runbooks and architecture diagrams
- **Monitoring Setup**: Implement monitoring and alerting
- **Load Testing**: Verify performance under expected load

## Operational Phase

- **Knowledge Transfer**: Train the team on the new infrastructure
- **Incident Response Plan**: Update procedures for the new components
- **Regular Audits**: Schedule periodic reviews of configuration and security
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track actual costs against projections
