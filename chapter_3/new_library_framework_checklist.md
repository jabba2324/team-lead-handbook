# Checklist for a New Library or Framework

When adopting a new library or framework, use this checklist to evaluate its suitability and plan for implementation.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Maintenance Status**: Is it actively maintained? When was the last release?
- **Community Size**: How large and active is the community?
- **Documentation Quality**: Is the documentation comprehensive and up-to-date?
- **License**: Is the license compatible with your project?
- **Dependencies**: What are its dependencies and are they well-maintained?
- **Security**: Are there known vulnerabilities? How quickly are security issues addressed?
- **Performance**: How does it perform compared to alternatives?
- **Testing**: Is it well-tested? What's the test coverage?

## Implementation Steps

1. **Spike/POC**: Create a proof of concept to validate the library/framework
2. **Team Knowledge Sharing**: Ensure the team understands how to use it properly
3. **Integration Plan**: Plan how to integrate it with existing systems
4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for the new components
5. **Rollback Plan**: Have a plan to revert if issues arise

## Risk Assessment

- **Learning Curve**: How steep is the learning curve for the team?
- **Vendor Lock-in**: How difficult would it be to replace this library/framework later?
- **Support**: What support options are available if issues arise?
- **Compatibility**: Is it compatible with your existing tech stack?
