# Taking Dependency on Open Source

When incorporating open source software into your projects, consider these factors to make informed decisions and manage risks effectively.

## Evaluation Criteria

### Project Health
- **Activity**: Frequency of commits and releases
- **Community Size**: Number of contributors and users
- **Issue Resolution**: How quickly issues are addressed
- **Governance**: How decisions are made and by whom

### Technical Considerations
- **Code Quality**: Code standards, architecture, and technical debt
- **Test Coverage**: Extent and quality of automated tests
- **Documentation**: Comprehensiveness and clarity
- **Security**: History of vulnerabilities and response time
- **Performance**: Benchmarks and optimization

### Legal and Compliance
- **License Type**: Compatibility with your project (MIT, Apache, GPL, etc.)
- **Patent Grants**: Protection from patent litigation
- **Attribution Requirements**: What acknowledgments are required
- **Contribution Terms**: Terms for contributing back to the project

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Vendor Multiple Sources**: Avoid single-source dependencies
2. **Fork Option**: Be prepared to fork if necessary
3. **Contribution Strategy**: Plan for contributing back to maintain influence
4. **Dependency Isolation**: Isolate dependencies to limit impact
5. **Regular Audits**: Schedule periodic reviews of dependencies
