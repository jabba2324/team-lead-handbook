# Checklist for a New Language

When introducing a new programming language to your tech stack, consider the following factors to ensure a smooth adoption process.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Community Support**: Size and activity of the community, availability of resources
- **Maturity**: How long has the language been around, stability of releases
- **Learning Curve**: How difficult is it for your team to learn
- **Ecosystem**: Available libraries, frameworks, and tools
- **Performance**: Speed, memory usage, and scalability
- **Security**: Known vulnerabilities and security features
- **Hiring Pool**: Availability of developers with experience in this language
- **Long-term Support**: Roadmap and maintenance plans

## Implementation Steps

1. **Proof of Concept**: Build a small, non-critical component to test the language
2. **Team Training**: Provide resources and time for the team to learn
3. **Style Guide**: Establish coding standards and best practices
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up build, test, and deployment pipelines
5. **Monitoring & Observability**: Ensure you can monitor applications written in this language
6. **Documentation**: Create internal documentation for common patterns and practices

## Risk Assessment

- **Integration Challenges**: How will it work with existing systems?
- **Operational Overhead**: Additional maintenance requirements
- **Technical Debt**: Potential for creating new debt
- **Team Resistance**: How receptive is the team to the change?
