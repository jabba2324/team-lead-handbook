# Buy vs Build

The decision to buy an existing solution or build a custom one is a common challenge for technology teams. This framework helps evaluate the tradeoffs.

## Decision Framework

### Buy When:

- **Core vs. Context**: The functionality is not core to your business differentiation
- **Time to Market**: You need to implement quickly
- **Resource Constraints**: Your team lacks specialized expertise or bandwidth
- **Standardization**: The problem is well-understood with established solutions
- **Cost Efficiency**: TCO of buying is lower than building and maintaining
- **Maintenance**: You want to offload maintenance and updates

### Build When:

- **Competitive Advantage**: The functionality provides unique business value
- **Specific Requirements**: Off-the-shelf solutions don't meet your specific needs
- **Integration Complexity**: Custom integration would be more complex than building
- **Long-term Control**: You need complete control over the roadmap
- **Intellectual Property**: You want to own the IP for strategic reasons
- **Cost at Scale**: At your scale, building becomes more cost-effective

## Evaluation Matrix

Create a weighted decision matrix with the following factors:

1. **Strategic Alignment**: How well does the solution align with business strategy?
2. **Time to Value**: How quickly can you realize benefits?
3. **Total Cost of Ownership**: Initial and ongoing costs
4. **Risk**: Technical, operational, and business risks
5. **Flexibility**: Ability to adapt to changing requirements
6. **Integration**: Ease of integration with existing systems
7. **Support & Maintenance**: Resources required for ongoing support
