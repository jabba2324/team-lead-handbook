## Value/Effort quadrant
A common challange of technical debt (or any non product backlog) is prioritising the work and communicating it's value to people who don't have an engineering background. 

To aid us with this we can create a quadrant with a value axis and effort axis. Going though our backlog we can tag/label each task with High/Low value and High/Low effort grouping our backlong into four buckets. Seperating the quick wins from big projects.

* High Value & Low Effort (Quick Wins)
* High Value & High Effort (Big Projects)
* Low Value & Low Effort (Fill Ins)
* Low Value & High Effort (Time Sinks)

#### What is effort?
You may want to replace High/Low with story points or some other measurement of effort but the sentiment is the same, how long will the task take to complete.

#### What is value?
This really depends on your team and product. Broadley speaking the value is how much this task will improve speed of delivery for non tech debt tasks such as product development. It could also be about reducing business risk such as tweaking auto sclaing or improving security, the value would represent the risk to the business not doing it. 

In the given order above you can now prioritise and communicate your backlog, most task tracking tools such as JIRA or AzureDevops will allow you to query based on labels making these high value tech debt items easy to find and bring into focus.
