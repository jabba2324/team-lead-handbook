## Readmes
Similar to an instruction manual. We can describe a README file as a guide that gives users a detailed description of a project. It can also be described as documentation with guidelines on how to use a project. Usually, it will have instructions on how to install and run the project. It's a very important document to have in place for people joining the team and setting up their local environment. Good readmes will have a title, description, the problem it solves, and the project's local setup. Additionally, it may have things like contribution guidelines, licenses, build & release statuses, and a [Team API](/chapter_1/team_apis.md).

Typically written in markdown. You can build richer & more complex documents with a table of contents, embedded images, animations, and more.
