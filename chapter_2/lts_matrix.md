# LTS Matrix

An LTS (Long-Term Support) matrix is a tool for tracking the lifecycle status of technologies, frameworks, and dependencies used in your systems. It helps teams make informed decisions about upgrades, maintenance, and technical debt.

## Purpose of an LTS Matrix

- **Risk Management**: Identify technologies approaching end-of-life or support
- **Upgrade Planning**: Schedule and prioritize necessary upgrades
- **Technical Debt Tracking**: Visualize aging components in your stack
- **Resource Allocation**: Justify investment in upgrades and maintenance
- **Compliance**: Ensure systems meet security and regulatory requirements

## Components of an LTS Matrix

### 1. Technology Inventory
- List all languages, frameworks, libraries, and platforms
- Include version numbers currently in use
- Note which systems or applications use each technology

### 2. Support Timeline
- Release date of each version
- End of active support date
- End of security support date
- Extended support options (if available)

### 3. Risk Assessment
- Current status (supported, maintenance only, end-of-life)
- Time remaining until support ends
- Upgrade complexity (low, medium, high)
- Business impact if not upgraded

### 4. Action Plan
- Planned upgrade timeline
- Required resources and dependencies
- Testing and deployment strategy
- Fallback plans

## Example LTS Matrix Format

| Technology | Current Version | Release Date | End of Support | Status | Risk Level | Upgrade Plan | Owner |
|------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|--------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Node.js | 14.17.0 | Apr 2020 | Apr 2023 | Maintenance | High | Upgrade to v18 by Q1 2023 | Team Alpha |
| Python | 3.7.10 | Jun 2018 | Jun 2023 | Maintenance | Medium | Upgrade to 3.10 by Q2 2023 | Team Beta |
| Ubuntu | 18.04 LTS | Apr 2018 | Apr 2023 | Maintenance | High | Migrate to 22.04 by Q1 2023 | Ops Team |
| Angular | 11.2.0 | Nov 2020 | May 2022 | End of Life | Critical | Upgrade to v14 by Q4 2022 | Team Gamma |
| Java | 11.0.12 | Sep 2018 | Sep 2026 | Active | Low | No action needed | Team Delta |

## LTS Policies for Common Technologies

### Programming Languages

| Language | LTS Policy | Typical Support Duration | Notes |
|----------|------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Node.js | Even-numbered versions are LTS | ~3 years (30 months + 6 months EOL) | [Node.js Release Schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) |
| Python | Releases supported for 5 years | 5 years | [Python Release Cycle](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) |
| Java | LTS every 3 years (8, 11, 17) | 8+ years for LTS | [Oracle Java Support Roadmap](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html) |
| PHP | Each version supported for 3 years | 2 years active + 1 year security | [PHP Supported Versions](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) |
| Ruby | Approximately 3 years | 3-4 years | [Ruby Maintenance Branches](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/) |

### Frameworks and Libraries

| Framework | LTS Policy | Typical Support Duration | Notes |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Angular | Major version every 6 months | 18 months | [Angular Support Policy](https://angular.io/guide/releases) |
| React | No official LTS policy | Continuous updates | Facebook maintains backward compatibility |
| Spring Boot | Even-numbered versions are LTS | 3 years | [Spring Support Policy](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) |
| .NET | Even-numbered versions are LTS | 3 years | [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) |
| Django | LTS every 2 years | 3 years | [Django Releases](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/) |

### Operating Systems

| OS | LTS Policy | Typical Support Duration | Notes |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Ubuntu | Even-numbered years, April releases | 5 years (10 for ESM) | [Ubuntu Releases](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle) |
| RHEL/CentOS | Major versions every ~5 years | 10 years | [RHEL Life Cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata) |
| Windows Server | LTSC releases | 10 years (5+5) | [Windows Server Servicing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/windows-server-release-info) |
| Amazon Linux | Major versions | 5 years | [Amazon Linux Support](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/faqs/) |
| Debian | Stable releases every ~2 years | ~3-5 years | [Debian Releases](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases) |

## Best Practices for LTS Management

### 1. Regular Review
- Schedule quarterly reviews of the LTS matrix
- Update after major releases of key technologies
- Align reviews with budget and planning cycles

### 2. Proactive Upgrade Planning
- Start planning upgrades 12 months before end-of-support
- Include upgrade work in regular sprint planning
- Consider feature freezes during major upgrades

### 3. Risk-Based Prioritization
- Focus on high-risk, high-impact technologies first
- Consider security implications of outdated dependencies
- Balance technical debt against business priorities

### 4. Documentation
- Maintain upgrade guides for key technologies
- Document known issues and workarounds
- Keep records of previous upgrade experiences

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Develop comprehensive test plans for upgrades
- Use automated testing to verify functionality
- Consider blue/green deployments for critical systems
