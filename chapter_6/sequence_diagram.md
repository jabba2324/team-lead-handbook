## Sequence Diagram
Part of the UML family of diagramns. A Sequence diagram shows us system flow control when triggered by an actor. It illustrates how different systems communicate with eachother in sequence, their dependencies on eachother and the types of messages they might send.

Actors are represented by the stick men in the top left. These are typically users of a system. The rectangles represent systems such as APIs, UIs or databases. The vertical line represents time and vertical blocks respresent a thread within that system. Finally with the horizonal arrows and their labels representing messages being sent between systems.

The UML family of diagrams is quite large with varying usefulness, squence diagrams however have proven to be consistently valuable when understanding complex systems and message flows.

### Examples
Sequence diagrams are very common. A quick google image search will give many examples.
