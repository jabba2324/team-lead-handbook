# Whiteboarding System Design
Whiteboarding system design is a collaborative approach to visualizing and planning software architecture. It's valuable for both system design discussions and technical interviews. It is a common excersize when interviewing for a role in a FAANG tech company. 

## Process

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system needs to do
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, scalability, reliability
- **Constraints**: Budget, technology, time, team expertise
- **Assumptions**: Document assumptions to clarify scope

### 2. High-Level Design
- **System Components**: Major building blocks
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through the system
- **User Interactions**: How users interact with the system
- **Integration Points**: External systems and APIs

### 3. Detailed Design
- **Data Model**: Key entities and relationships
- **API Design**: Endpoints, methods, parameters
- **State Management**: How state is maintained
- **Error Handling**: Strategies for handling failures

### 4. Scaling Considerations
- **Bottlenecks**: Identify potential bottlenecks
- **Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling**: Approaches for different components
- **Caching Strategies**: Where and how to implement caching
- **Database Scaling**: Sharding, replication, etc.

## Whiteboarding Techniques

### 1. Box and Arrow Diagrams
- Simple boxes for components
- Arrows showing data flow
- Labels for key interactions
- Different shapes for different component types

### 2. Layered Architecture
- Horizontal layers (presentation, business logic, data)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Dependencies between layers

### 3. Component Diagrams
- Detailed view of specific components
- Internal structure
- Interfaces and dependencies

### 4. Sequence Diagrams
- Time-ordered interactions
- Request/response flows
- Asynchronous processes

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Begin with the simplest design that meets requirements
- **Iterate**: Add complexity only as needed
- **Engage Audience**: Encourage participation and questions
- **Validate**: Check design against requirements
- **Document Decisions**: Note key decisions and trade-offs
- **Use Consistent Notation**: Establish meaning of symbols

## Examples

### Video Tutorials

- [System Design Interview: Design YouTube - Approach a System Design Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPKTo1iGQiE) - A popular video by Exponent with over 1.2 million views that walks through how to approach a system design interview at FAANG companies, using YouTube as the example system to design. The video demonstrates effective whiteboarding techniques, how to structure your approach, and common patterns used in successful interviews.

- [System Design Mock Interview: Design Instagram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJpfO6KdyWE) - A mock interview by Clement Mihailescu (ex-Google, ex-Facebook) showing how to design Instagram in a FAANG interview setting, with practical whiteboarding examples.
