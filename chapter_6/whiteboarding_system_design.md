# Whiteboarding System Design

Whiteboarding system design is a collaborative approach to visualizing and planning software architecture. It's valuable for both system design discussions and technical interviews.

## Process

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system needs to do
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, scalability, reliability
- **Constraints**: Budget, technology, time, team expertise
- **Assumptions**: Document assumptions to clarify scope

### 2. High-Level Design
- **System Components**: Major building blocks
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through the system
- **User Interactions**: How users interact with the system
- **Integration Points**: External systems and APIs

### 3. Detailed Design
- **Data Model**: Key entities and relationships
- **API Design**: Endpoints, methods, parameters
- **State Management**: How state is maintained
- **Error Handling**: Strategies for handling failures

### 4. Scaling Considerations
- **Bottlenecks**: Identify potential bottlenecks
- **Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling**: Approaches for different components
- **Caching Strategies**: Where and how to implement caching
- **Database Scaling**: Sharding, replication, etc.

## Whiteboarding Techniques

### 1. Box and Arrow Diagrams
- Simple boxes for components
- Arrows showing data flow
- Labels for key interactions
- Different shapes for different component types

### 2. Layered Architecture
- Horizontal layers (presentation, business logic, data)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Dependencies between layers

### 3. Component Diagrams
- Detailed view of specific components
- Internal structure
- Interfaces and dependencies

### 4. Sequence Diagrams
- Time-ordered interactions
- Request/response flows
- Asynchronous processes

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Begin with the simplest design that meets requirements
- **Iterate**: Add complexity only as needed
- **Engage Audience**: Encourage participation and questions
- **Validate**: Check design against requirements
- **Document Decisions**: Note key decisions and trade-offs
- **Use Consistent Notation**: Establish meaning of symbols
