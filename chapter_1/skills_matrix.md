## Skills Matrix
A skills matrix is a document capturing the confidence and competence of a cross-functional team. It can help visualize where the team has a lack of confidence or scarcity of particular skills. You might use this to understand the risk of particular team members falling sick, leaving, or taking long holidays. It can also inform hiring or training investment in a team. 

Quite simply a skills matrix is a spreadsheet with the relevant skills and team members. Each with a grading out of 10 for the level of confidence/competence for each team member. Below is an example grading system, you will probably have to customise the grading for your team.
