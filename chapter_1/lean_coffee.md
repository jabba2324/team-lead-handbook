### Lean Coffee
Often useful for retroes but generally useful prioritising a discussion that could take longer than the available time allows such as refining a backlog or an epic. Lean Coffee is a structured, but agenda-less meeting. Participants gather, build an agenda, and begin talking. Conversations are directed and productive because the agenda for the meeting was democratically generated. 

As a facilitator, every participant is given sticky notes for their subjects. the meeting is then broken down into three phases:
1. Preperation, putting together a kanban board or something to track topics to discuss, in discussion and finished discussions.
2. Participants put their topics on the board and group similiar ones together. Once it's all down people vote on which things to talk about, each team member has two votes for any topic, they can also vote on the same topic twice.
3. Discuss each topic in order of most voted to least voted until you run out of time. Make sure to create actions at the end of each discussion.
