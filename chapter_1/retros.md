## Retros
The handbook tries to avoid talking about agile as it's already a widely discussed and understood (or misunderstood) topic. But regardless of what flavour or religion of agile you follow retros are almost always something the team needs. Here we outline some of the more popular approaches, with [lean coffee](/chapter_1/lean_coffee.md) getting its own page. Simply put the idea of a retro is to understand what is making the team happy, unhappy, or otherwise uncomfortable in a way that is democratic and doesn't entertain time-sinking tangents.

Most retrospectives tend to follow a similar structure, beginning with each team member writing a sticky note for a topic they want to discuss, the facilitator aggregating similar topics and the team taking a vote on what to discuss. Working through each topic and hopefully producing some actions for team members to take away. Some ways to approach framing the topics are:

#### Start, Stop, Continue
Useful for identifying specific actions to take, looking both backward and forwards. The Start Stop Continue is a very action-oriented retro framework that helps teams determine what past actions are worth stopping or continuing, and what new ideas are worth giving a try. 

#### Good, Bad & Ugly
A slightly more themed format that focuses on opportunities for improvement based on difficulties or frustrations that the team may have experienced in the last sprint or quarter. Helpful in environments with low automation or a less-than-ideal developer experience.

#### 4L 
Consider this when focusing on learning. This retrospective is handy for when you want to take your team’s pulse about how a project, sprint, or quarter went, with a focus on growth and learning. The four quadrants are usually Loved, Learned, Lacked, and Longed for — though some teams make modifications.
