## Team APIs
From the popular book Team Topologies, there is a living document called a Team API. A team API is something that communicates what your team does and how people can interact with them. Typically a markdown or confluence document. 

### Example
A template from the team topologies repository [here](https://github.com/TeamTopologies/Team-API-template).

### Source
Based on some of the ideas in the book Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton @matthewskelton and Manuel Pais @manupaisable. See pages 47-49 of the book Team Topologies.
